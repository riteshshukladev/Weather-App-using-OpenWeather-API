# Weather App


## Overview

Weather App is a user-friendly web application that allows users to easily access real-time weather data for any city across the globe. The app utilizes the OpenWeather API to fetch accurate and up-to-date weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and more.

## Features

1. **Search by City Name**: Users can simply enter the name of the city they want to know the weather for, and the app will retrieve the relevant data.

2. **Predefined City Selection**: For convenience, the app offers a list of predefined cities. Users can select one of these cities, and the weather information will be displayed instantly.

3. **Dynamic Backgrounds and Icons**: The app provides visually appealing weather-specific background images and icons, reflecting the current weather conditions of the selected city.

4. **Real-Time Weather Data**: The app fetches real-time weather data through the OpenWeather API, ensuring that users receive the most accurate and up-to-date information.

5. **Error Handling**: In case of an invalid city name or an issue with the API, the app displays a user-friendly error message, guiding the user to enter a valid city name.

6. **Timezone-based Date and Time**: The app automatically adjusts the date and time display according to the timezone of the searched city, providing localized weather information.

## How to Use

1. **Search for a City**: Start by entering the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the input field.

2. **Click on a Predefined City**: Alternatively, choose a city from the list of predefined cities for quick access to its weather data.
